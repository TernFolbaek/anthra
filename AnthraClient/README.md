## Luminar
### Mission:
#### Facilitate the bridge building between academics, users can choose if they want to connect with individuals which practice or study within the same field, or they can connect with others who practice
#### in another field, and learn something new. There are many study platforms whose service is live note writing and document sharing. There is no large platform which allows for building connections
#### between passionate individuals based off their interests and academic achievements.
#### How the app stands out:
* Connections - Most study platforms are to work on the platforms itself, by providing online notes, or utilizing them for note taking, whereas this app offers connecting with other users with the same academic interests as its service, thereafter the users can decide how they want to progress their relationship.
* Group feature - after matching with a user, one of the users can suggest another user to enter their group by sending their profile in chat, you can only suggest someone you have matched with, and once the profile is sent the user being sent AND the other user who is being sent their profile need to accept this invitation for them to enter the group chat. This will ensure formality and a sense of seriousness to the app which snapchat does not have.
